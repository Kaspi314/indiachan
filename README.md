Indiachan frontend
==================

This is default frontend for [Indiachan](https://indiachan.com).
To setup/run, follow everything from [Lynxchan](https://gitgud.io/LynxChan/LynxChan) instructions.
Only instead of using default placeholder frontend, clone and place this repo.

```
LynxChan root
 ├ aux
 ├ doc
 └ src
    ├ be
    └ fe ← place this repo here
```

Follow usual instructions at https://gitgud.io/LynxChan/LynxChan/blob/master/src/be/Readme.md for commands.
You'll need to create a root user immediately after setting this up. Afterwards, login as root
http://localhost:8080/login.html and create boards etc.
